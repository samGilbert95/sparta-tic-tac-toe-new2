# Sparta Tic Tac Toe
### Description
Had to make the game of Tic Tac Toe using Javascript to control HTML and CSS files.

### Languages used
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

### How to download
1. Git Clone down into the folder that you want.


### Challenges (you can include images and code block here)
Attempting to set a win condition to the project has proven very difficult given the timeframe alotted.
Although I have researched multiple different ways to approach the problem (indexOf,some(),regex etc), i have been
unable to develop a solution.

### Learning points
I need to learn to keep better track of my code, especially when dealing with nested loops
Approaching a task with an OOP structure in mind is much easier now.
Commenting as i go has helped me to better understand areas of my work.
